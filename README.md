# GitHub-Finder
This Web App helps you find users then display their profile and repositories.

If you are getting a copy, be sure to create a config.js file in the root directory,
then put your token this way:
```
const config = {
    Authorization: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'
}
```
If you don't have a token, you can generate one on: https://github.com/settings/tokens
